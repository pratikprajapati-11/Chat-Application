## 💬 Real-Time Chat Application

A full-stack real-time chat application built using **React.js** and **Node.js** that allows users to communicate instantly through one-to-one messaging. The application supports secure authentication, real-time online status, media sharing, profile management, and multiple theme options including light and dark modes.

## 📖 Project Description

This is a **full-stack real-time chat application** designed to provide fast, secure, and user-friendly communication between users. The frontend is developed using **React.js** with **Tailwind CSS** for responsive UI design, **React Router** for smooth navigation, **Zustand** for global state management, and **Socket.IO client** for real-time messaging.

The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **MongoDB (Mongoose)** for database management. Real-time communication is handled using **Socket.IO**, while user authentication and authorization are secured using **JWT** and **bcrypt.js**. Media sharing such as images and videos is supported using **Cloudinary**.

The application includes essential chat features such as user signup, login, logout, profile updates, real-time online user tracking, theme selection (light, dark, and more), and one-to-one messaging with media support. The system is designed with scalability, security, and performance in mind.
